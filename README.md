## Introduction

Support Vector Machines are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.

## Features

- Support for binary classification
- Linear and non-linear kernels (e.g., polynomial, RBF)
- Customizable hyperparameters (C, gamma, etc.)
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Support for multi-class classification through One-vs-One and One-vs-Rest approaches

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanrivertarik/svm.git
cd svm-implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the SVM implementation, you can import the `svm` module in your Python script. Below is a basic example:

```python
from svm import SVM
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

# Initialize and train the SVM model
model = SVM(C=1.0, kernel='linear')
model.fit(X, y)

# Predicting new data
predictions = model.predict(np.array([[4, 5], [5, 6]]))
print(predictions)
```

## Examples

For more detailed examples, please refer to the `examples` directory in the repository. You will find Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various use cases and features of the SVM implementation.
